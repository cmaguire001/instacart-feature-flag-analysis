# Instacart Feature Flag Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **beginner-friendly product analytics workflow** using the Instacart Market Basket dataset. 
It simulates a **feature flag experiment** to measure the impact of a new recommendation engine on user behavior.  

**Skills showcased:**
- Data cleaning and exploration with Pandas  
- Basic descriptive analytics and visualizations  
- Simulated A/B testing / feature flag analysis  
- Storytelling with actionable insights  

---

## Dataset
The dataset is from **[Kaggle: Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data)**.  
Key files used:  
- `orders.csv`  
---

## Analysis Steps
1. Explore orders data (busiest day and hour of orders)  
2. Calculate reorder frequency  
3. Simulate a feature flag experiment (control vs treatment users)  
4. Compare metrics between groups  
5. Visualize insights with charts  

---

## Key Insights
- **Busiest day:** Sunday  
- **Busiest hour:** 10 AM  
- **Typical reorder frequency:** ~30 days  
- **Feature flag experiment:** In this simulation, control users ordered slightly more frequently; the feature did not have a real effect

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place CSVs in `data/raw/`  
2. Open the notebook `notebooks/Instacart_Feature_Flag_Analysis.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**  
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis
